Results are reported in the following preprint:

Waneka G, Broz AK, Wold-McGimsey F, Zou Y, Wu Z, Sloan DB. Submitted. [Disruption of recombination machinery alters the mutational landscape in plant organellar genomes](https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.06.03.597120). bioRxiv. 2024.06.03.597120

### Code

- `complex_snv_20230608.py` is a python script used for analysis of trinucleotide context, strand asymmetry, and dinucleotide mutation frequency.
- `Figures/r_code_figure_generation.Rmd` is an R Markdown script used for generation of manuscript figures
